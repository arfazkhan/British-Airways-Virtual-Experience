# My Experience with British Airways' Data Science Virtual Experience Programme
______________________________
## Task 1: Web Scraping to Gain Company Insights

I had an amazing opportunity to participate in the British Airways' Data Science Certificate Coursework offered by Forage. The first task I tackled was focused on web scraping to gain valuable insights about the company through customer reviews.

As a complete newbie in the field of data analysis, I initially had no idea how to approach this task. However, with the guidance and resources provided by British Airways and Forage, I was able to dive in headfirst. I used the recommended website, Skytrax, to scrape review data specifically related to the airline itself.

Collecting the data was just the first step. The real challenge came when I had to analyze and make sense of the messy and text-heavy dataset. I spent time cleaning the data to prepare it for analysis. To gain insights, I employed various techniques such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word clouds. These approaches helped me uncover interesting patterns and trends within the reviews.

Presenting my findings was another crucial aspect of the task. I carefully crafted a PowerPoint slide summarizing the key points from my analysis. I included compelling visualizations and metrics to effectively communicate the insights I discovered. The provided "PowerPoint Template" helped me structure my slide in a professional manner.

## Task 2: Predicting Customer Buying Behavior

The second task in the certificate coursework focused on building a predictive model to understand the factors influencing customer buying behavior. This was an exciting challenge that allowed me to delve deeper into the realm of machine learning.

Understanding the changing dynamics of the buying cycle and the importance of being proactive in acquiring customers, I realized the significance of predictive models. Manipulating and preparing the customer booking data was an essential step to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the model.

Once I had the dataset ready, I trained a machine learning model using the provided resources and the "Getting Started" Jupyter Notebook. Evaluating the model's performance through cross-validation and analyzing the contribution of each variable was an enlightening process. I chose the RandomForest algorithm for its ability to provide insights into variable importance within the model.

Presenting the findings was the final step of the task. I created a visually appealing PowerPoint slide using the "PowerPoint Template" provided. This allowed me to showcase the model's performance, the impact of each variable, and summarize my conclusions concisely.

Overall, the British Airways' Data Science Certificate Coursework from Forage provided me with a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience in data analysis and machine learning. I am grateful to British Airways and Forage for offering this insightful program and guiding me throughout the process. I look forward to applying the knowledge and skills I acquired in my future endeavors.
